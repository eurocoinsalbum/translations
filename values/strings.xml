    <string name="how_trading_partner_works">"
- The trading functionality is NOT for resellers and it is for PRIVATE usage only!
- The trading functionality is NOT for beginners.
- Read ALL this carefully! Otherwise you may be disappointed by the trading functionality.
- Trading coins with other traders is much more complex than you may think. Especially when the time of agreeing on the coins to be traded takes more than just a couple of hours you have to consider that the collection of your trading partner may have changed in the meantime. This has an impact.
- You grant permission to publish any information (notes, images, name, e-mail, country, ...) of your collection by using the trading functionality.
- You can trade coins with other users BUT using the trading functionality of this app MUST NOT be considered as an offer or as a contract in legal terms! Whatever you do or see in this app - it is not binding anyone to anything.
- The trading functionality can find trading partners for your currently selected collection.
- To find a trading partner you first need to give your collection a public name which will be visible to others and share your collection to the public.
- All coins of your collection will be available to others for selection except as many as you specified in the settings 'Trading: Coins to keep' which is 1(one) by default.
- You can explicitally exclude individual coins and prevent them from being traded via the coin's property 'Block trading'. Have in mind that even blocked coins will be visible to the public.
- If you don't want that all your coins are available for trading you have to split your collection first which can be done via the menu.
- Your collection needs to get a public name which will also be visible to others. The same applies to your e-mail adress.
- All information inside your collection will be visible to the public (notes, ...). By adding information you agree to only add valid information about the coin. Any abuse can be reported by others and might lead to the deletion of your account.
- You can select an image or take a photo and assign it to a coin. Any assigned image will be visible to the public. By doing so you agree to only assign images where you have the rights to do so and which shows the corresponding coin only. Any abuse can be reported by others and might lead to the deletion of your account.
- An abuse of the abuse feature might lead to the deletion of your account.
- You will receive one trading partner collection per request. You can link to the shown trading partner or requenst the next one. Once you got all trading partners the search will start over.
- By default you will receive trading partners having the same country of residence as you choosed in the settings. This behaviour could also be changed in the settings. Then you receive trading partners from all countries.
- Only those trading partners will be presented in the search which have used the app within the last days. This is to ensure that you do not get stale collections.
- If you want your collection to be found by other users you have to open the app once a week. Currently there is no push-notification for users who want to trade with you. You have to open the app - only then the app synchronizes the trading collections and you see if someone want's to trade coins with you.
- The trading partner collection will be downloaded and linked on your device too so that you can browse it fully.
- A new trading collection will be created on your device which combines your collection and the trading partner collection.
- The trading collection shows only these coins which are only present in one of the two base collections.
- The coins which your collection does NOT contain but are part of the trading partner's collection will be shown with a brighter image.
- The coins which your collection contains but are NOT part of the trading partner's collection will be shown with a darker image.
- Coins which have been selected for trading will show up in the trading basket. The basket at the top shows the coins which you will receive whereas the one at the bottom those which you have to send to your trading partner.
- You can remove a coin from the trading basket if you long touch the coin or with the remove-button in the coin details dialog where you added the coin. A tap on any coin in the trading basket will highlight that coin inside the collection view.
- A small red stop icon on the coin image in the trading basket indicates that this coin has no coin condition or photo assigned. Before the trade can be confirmed at the end it has to be removed or a coin condition or a photo has to be assigned in the corresponding collection which owns the coin.
- Initially a '0' is shown on each coin indicating that this coin is not part of the trading basket.
- Touch one of the coins to view the details of that coin.
- In the Detail-View (if you enabled the edit mode) you can use the 'add' button to add that coin to the trading basket.
- With the 'remove' button you can remove it.
- You can add and remove both sides: the coins you want to have and those you will give away.
- You should only add and remove coins of your trading partner when you have a good reason.
- After you add a coin to the trading basket a '1' will show up indicating that one of the coins was selected and added to the trading basket. A negativ number means that you give that coin away whereas a positive number indicates that you will receive that coin.
- If your collection or the trading partner's collection contain multiple coins of one specific coin then you can browse in the details view each of those coins. Choose exactly this coin you want to add to the trading basket which you want to have. Different coins may be in different conditions.
- On the top of the screen all coins which you will receive are listed. On the bottom all coins that you will give away will be listed. Touch any of those coins to switch to that coin. Long hold a coin to remove it from the trading collection. You can horizontally scroll through these lists.
- The statistic for trading collections is different to normal collections. x/y/z x=always negativ and showing how many coins you will give away; y=number of possible differnt coins to trade; z=always positiv and showing how many coins you will receive.
- Once you finished your selection send the trading request to your trading partner.
- The trading partner will be informed that a new trading session was initiated. Now your trading partner can edit the trading collection and send it back to you.
- To have a better overview it might makes sense to write down on paper the coins which have been selected for trading. Currently the app does not support a history of the trading collection. You always see only the current status.
- Both users can edit the trading basket after each other until one user does not change the collection any more but confirm the trade. If there is a difference in the nominal value of the coins between the two trading partners then this has to be equalized by adding the correct amount to the package.
- A trade can only be confirmed if each traded coin has either the coin condition property set or an individual image attached.
- After the trade was confirmed you and your trading partner will receive an email with each others e-mail-addresses and a list with the coins which have been selected for trading.
- When you successfully sent your coins plus an eventually amount of money to equalize a difference in the nominal value to your trading partner and received your new coins mark the trading collection as executed via the trading collection menu. Then the collection will not appear in the user's menu any more but in menu->collection->trading_partners->executed trades.
- While setting the trading collection to 'executed' you can choose to automatically update your collection. Choose 'No' to update your collection manually. With 'Edit' you are allowed to edit the trading collection even after it was confirmed. Use this for the case that the traded coins to not match the trading collection. But the trading collection will not be synchronized with your trading partner any more. After the traded coins and the trading collection match you can again mark the collection as executed and choose 'Yes' to automatically update your own collection.
- If you do not want to start or continue a trading session you can simply delete the trading collection. You will be asked if you want to delete the underlying trading partner collection as well.
        <!-- Trading text change -->
        - At any time you can retract your collection from the public.

    <string name="twoeuro_comm_2023_mt_2_desc">"In June 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte ended the rule of the Order of St John in Malta.
